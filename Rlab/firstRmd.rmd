## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be *generated* that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
mean(cars$speed)
table(mtcars$am)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, error=TRUE}
n <- 100
rnd <- runif(n)
histogram(rnd)
```

## Header
### Sub-header

We have loaded a dataset with `r nrow(mtcars)` observations, 
with `r length(unique(mtcars$am))` types of transmissions
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(pander)
pander(table(mtcars$am))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(pander)
pander(summary(cars))

fit <- lm(mpg ~wt,mtcars)
pander(fit)

pander(head(mtcars))

pander(head(mtcars), emphasize.strong.cells(3))
```

##DYNAMIC THINGS COME FROM HERE - SHINY

```{r}
library(shiny)
inputPanel(
  sliderInput('n', label='Sample size',
              min=1, max=1000, value=100,
              step = 10)
  )
renderPlot(
  hist(runif(as.numeric(input$n)))
)
```
